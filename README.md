# 🚀 30 Days Lost in Space: Repair, Code, Escape

**Welcome, Explorer!**  
You’ve crash-landed on an alien planet—your systems are fried, your ship’s lights are out, and worst of all... your entertainment system is offline. But worry not. You’ve got tools, a trusty AI companion named **Astrid**, and exactly **30 days** to fix it all and return to the mothership.

This GitHub repository contains the full script, code, and mission details for the **30 Days Lost in Space** course—an immersive adventure in **Arduino coding** and **circuit building** for beginners and aspiring space engineers.
